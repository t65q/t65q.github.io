          <p>Upcoming outings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scout Day at NYC FC, May 19 1:10 PM at Yankee Stadium. We can buy tickets together or go separately. Also, this is the same day as the next event.</li>
  <li>Urban hike to Chinatown Ice Cream Factory. Start from Astoria, hike into Manhattan, and afterward, either train home or head to the NYC FC game.</li>
  <li>Six Flags Great Escape Camporee, June 9-10. Lake George, NY (a four hour drive). We have deadlines approaching to register for this, so we’d like to know tonight or by next week who is interested in going and who can drive. We’ll need to collect payment next week. It’s approximately $75 per attendee.</li>
  <li>Summer Camp at TMR, July 15-21. Registration is already closed, but we hope you’ll join us next year.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other events:</p>

<ul>
  <li>On April 19 from 6:00 PM, Pack 90 is having a crossover ceremony for their Webelos II group, two of whom are joining our Troop. Thanks to the Scouts and leaders who are able to make it.</li>
  <li>It’s almost time to hold an outings workshop. Once the Scoutmasters meet with the Senior Patrol Leader, the Patrol Leaders Council will get to work with the troop on outings selection for next year.</li>
  <li>Program planning for next year will coincide with the outings workshop. Stay tuned!</li>
  <li>It’s also almost time for an end of year celebration and Court of Honor to recognize the advancement and achievements we’ve earned, individually and as a troop. Planning for this will start shortly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tonight we’ll be talking about animals, and especially how we can conduct Scouting activities while respecting animals. These are principles we can put into practice on our upcoming camping trip.</p>

<p>During the patrol meeting time, campers will conduct a gear inspection and finalize equipment preparation.</p>
