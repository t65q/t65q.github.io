title: Meeting Plan for 7th of March
author: Scoutmaster Aaron

This month we are tackling two things. Our theme is Technology, which is a broad subject. We'll cover Energy, Transportaion, Information, and Camping technologies. Tonight we start with Energy.

The meeting plan is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dVWBNYts4LDxssOR9-XnRfqdWOVM8JYvkW1XDlv44-I/edit?usp=sharing).

The second thing we're doing this month is troop reorganization and program planning, which go hand in hand. Troop elections are tonight. Once we have filled the essential positions by election (Senior PAtrol Leader and Patrol Leaders) and by appointment (e.g., Quartermaster, Webmaster, Troop Guide), we will schedule a Patrol Leaders' Conference. Later in the month, we will have an Outings Workshop, where we begin to plan our outings for the next program year. This process will be driven by the Scouts through their patrol leadership.

Note the upcoming outing for this weekend: We're volunteering to plant beach grass at Coney Island, worth 3 hours of service. After, those who are interested can join us for a visit to the NY Aquarium.
