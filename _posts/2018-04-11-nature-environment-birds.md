author: Scoutmaster Aaron

First, announcements.

Currently we have 3 or 4 Scouts who have indicated that they are planning to go to the upcoming camping trip the weekend of April 21. If you are planning to go, bring your $40 camper fee tonight, so we can have a final headcount, as well as the money to purchase food.

For those of you going to summer camp at TMR, merit badge signup is open now. Login early and select your merit badges, because some of them fill up quickly.

Also remember that, to get the best possible rate for summer camp, all camp fees are due by the end of May. Plan accordingly.

Upcoming outings:

* Camping trip, April 20-22. Suggestion was Baiting Hollow, but some of that is subject to change. We will finalize plans tonight.
* Scout Day at NYC FC, May 19 1:10 PM at Yankee Stadium. We can buy tickets together or go separately. Also, this is the same day as the next event.
* Urban hike to Chinatown Ice Cream Factory. Start from Astoria, hike into Manhattan, and afterward, either train home or head to the NYC FC game.
* Six Flags Great Escape Camporee, June 9-10. Lake George, NY (a four hour drive). We have deadlines approaching to register for this, so we'll need a headcount ASAP.
* Summer Camp at TMR, July 15-21. Registration is already closed, but we hope you'll join us next year.

Other events:

* It's almost time to hold an outings workshop. Once the Scoutmasters meet with the Senior Patrol Leader, the Patrol Leaders Council will get to work with the troop on outings selection for next year.
* Program planning for next year will coincide with the outings workshop. Stay tuned!
* It's also almost time for an end of year celebration and Court of Honor to recognize the advancement and achievements we've earned, individually and as a troop. Planning for this will start shortly.

Tonight's meeting will focus on identifying birds. We'll talk about what features make birds unique among animals, learn some methods to identify birds, and talk about their role in gauging the health of the environment. For those attending the upcoming camping trip, we'll have a bird field guide and our instructional materials to help identify birds.

Additionally, the patrols will have their normal meetings, but the campers will need to finalize their camping plans, namely the menu and the activities they want to do.

Given the need for timeliness during this round of state tests, we should plan to finish everything by 8:20.
