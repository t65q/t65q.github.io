author: Scoutmaster Aaron
---
Upcoming outings:

* Scout Day at NYC FC, May 19 1:10 PM at Yankee Stadium. Let us know ASAP if you want to go, so we can get the group rate.
* Urban hike to Chinatown Ice Cream Factory. Start from Astoria, hike into Manhattan, and afterward, either train home or head to the NYC FC game.
* Six Flags Great Escape Camporee, June 9-10. Lake George, NY (a four hour drive). We have deadlines approaching to register for this, so we'd like to know tonight or by next week who is interested in going and who can drive. We'll need to collect payment next week. It's approximately $75 per attendee.
* Summer Camp at TMR, July 15-21.

Other events:

* It’s almost time to hold an outings workshop. Once the Scoutmasters meet with the Senior Patrol Leader, the Patrol Leaders Council will get to work with the troop on outings selection for next year.
* Program planning for next year will coincide with the outings workshop. Stay tuned!
* It’s also almost time for an end of year celebration and Court of Honor to recognize the advancement and achievements we’ve earned, individually and as a troop. Planning for this will start shortly.

Tonight we will be talking about plants, their impact on the environment, and the many uses of plants. We also will take some time to learn about edible wild plants.
