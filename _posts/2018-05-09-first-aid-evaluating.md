May is First Aid month. Tonight we'll be going over the the first step to administering first aid, which is to evaluate the scene.

The meeting plan is here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/17sIRzOG3H4LBv2JWy_XZ6t1d576nDFcNEiW5RBIHkLk/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17sIRzOG3H4LBv2JWy_XZ6t1d576nDFcNEiW5RBIHkLk/edit?usp=sharing)

Other things to note:

* Payments for summer camp are due by the end of May if you want the early bird price.
* Sign up to go see Nathaniel perform in a production of Peter Pan. Tickets are here: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe10luWGQOex2QjCFLotrAOnVuTTNykRWy4F8SrcXyiCD6Q4w/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe10luWGQOex2QjCFLotrAOnVuTTNykRWy4F8SrcXyiCD6Q4w/viewform)
