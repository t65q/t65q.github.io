title: Meeting Plan for the 28th of March

It's been a doozy of a month. Back to back snow storms have forced us to miss two of our meetings, but we will adapt.

Tonight we'll finish up our technology theme with a look at camping technologies in particular and scouting technologies more generally.

The meeting plan is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11CUhviigsRrLLd1PSjhwJpFbgKXaZfyPBRPWMC9je5A/edit?usp=sharing).

Because our next campout is right around the corner, the patrols should begin preparation (get head counts, work on menus, and assign duties).

We will also finalize the leadership position assignments, including troop guide, quartermaster, webmaster, and scribe.

Just a note: a Cub Scouts pack, Pack 201, has expressed interest in visiting us tonight, so we should be prepared and make them feel welcome.

There is no meeting next week because of Spring Break, but there is an outing on the 7th of April. Do let us know if you can come and help clean up the Astoria Park shoreline for a couple of hours, starting at 10 AM.
