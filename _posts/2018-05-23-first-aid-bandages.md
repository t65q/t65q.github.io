title: First Aid -- Bandages

This week weâ€™re going to work on bandages, and each Scout should have plenty of opportunity to practice applying bandages. The Troop Challenge even reinforces this concept, as each Patrol will race through a relay applying bandages in turn.

The meeting plan is here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/19tg9e61J02yEMrBTus91DPBl951UjZmzhmAc74n6YBI/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19tg9e61J02yEMrBTus91DPBl951UjZmzhmAc74n6YBI/edit?usp=sharing)

Patrols should be planning for the next camping trip.

Our list of events for the year is dwindling. The two biggest things we have left for the year are one last campout and summer camp, although it would be great if we could find time for two more smaller outings: a new date for our rained out ice cream hike, and a date for an intensive first aid event to put all of our skills into practice.
