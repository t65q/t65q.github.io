title: First Aid -- Basics
author: Scoutmaster Aaron
---
Continuing our first aid theme, we'll be talking about basic first aid for minor injuries, animal and insect bites, and exposure to hazardous plants.

The meeting plan is here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/17f9rj8VOvnbQAcWlNTkKHSACfFVQy3zCT96N5oujj0k/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17f9rj8VOvnbQAcWlNTkKHSACfFVQy3zCT96N5oujj0k/edit?usp=sharing)

Other things to note:

* It's looking like rain this weekend. That may impact our urban hike, but not the game!
* We need to decide on a location and time for the next campout in June.
* We also need to decide if we want to participate in the Founders District Skills Rally on June 2.
